M
This indicates the mode of the source. ^ means a server, = means a peer and # indicates a locally connected reference clock.
S
This column indicates the state of the sources. "*" indicates the source to which chronyd is currently synchronized. "+" indicates acceptable sources which are combined with 
the selected source. "-" indicates acceptable sources which are excluded by the combining algorithm. "?" indicates sources to which connectivity has been lost or whose packets 
do not pass all tests. "x" indicates a clock which chronyd thinks is a falseticker (its time is inconsistent with a majority of other sources). "~" indicates a source whose time 
appears to have too much variability. The "?" condition is also shown at start-up, until at least 3 samples have been gathered from it.
